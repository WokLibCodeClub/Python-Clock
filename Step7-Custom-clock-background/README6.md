3. Draw the numbers

We have made a loop to draw 60 short, thin tick marks. But now we also want 12 medium tick marks **AND** 4 short, fat tick marks. We could duplicate all the code for the 60 ticks but with different values, but duplicating code is one thing a Python coder should **never** do.

Instead we're going to make a general purpose tick-drawing *function*.
