### 3. Draw the numbers

Our clock is almost complete. The only remaining task is to draw the numbers.

We can do this using another loop - a repeat 12 times loop.



This is the last stage. You should now have a customised clock which keeps proper time. If you want to make it bigger or smaller you should only have to change the value of the variable ```clock_radius```. Try that now, and see if it works.

Congratulations on your clock!
