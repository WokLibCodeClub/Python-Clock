### Draw all the different size ticks

We've written code, including a loop, to draw 60 short, thin tick marks. So all we need to do to get the 12 medium tick marks and the 4 short, fat tick marks is copy the same code but change some of the values, right?

#### **WRONG!**

This would mean duplicating code and duplicating code is one thing a Python coder should **never** do.

Instead we're going to make a general purpose tick-drawing *function*.
