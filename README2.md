If you have the hour in a variable called ```H```, the minutes in a variable called ```M``` and the seconds in a variable called ```S``` then you could write the time on the screen using
```
t.write(str(H)+str(M)+str(S))
```

Try this and see what happens by saving your code and running it.

You could improve this by putting a colon in between each of the values: ```str(H)+":"+str(M)+``` etc. Edit your code to get a display with colons.
