# Making the minute and hour hands move

We are going to follow the same steps we used to make the second hand point in the right direction, first for the minute hand, then for the hour hand.

### Setting the direction for the minute hand to point

The first step for the minute hand is to work out **how many degrees this hand moves every second**.

**Here is a very important point:** Python is really good at doing calculations. So coders *never* have to work out difficult sums - the computer can do that. What the coder has to do is **_work out the right formula_** to give the computer so the computer can calculate the right answer.

To work out the formula for the minute hand we can use these facts:

+ at the beginning of the hour the minute hand points up towards 12 o'clock
+ the minute hand takes exactly one hour to go right round the clock until it's pointing at 12 o'clock again
+ there are 360Â° in a circle
+ there are 60 seconds in a minute
+ there are 60 minutes in an hour

What is the formula for **how many degrees the minute hand moves in a second**?

Go [here](README2.md) for a hint.

The second step is to find a formula for **how many seconds have passed since the minute hand pointed at the 12**. 

We can then multiply the two formulas together to find the angle where the minute hand should point.

Here are some facts we need to use for **how many seconds have passed since the minute hand pointed at the 12**:

+ the minute hand starts pointing towards the 12 at the beginning of the hour
+ the number of minutes since the hour began is in a variable called ```M```
+ there are 60 seconds in every minute
+ the number of seconds since the minute began is in a variable called ```S```

Can you work out the Python formula, using the variables ```M``` and ```S```, to calculate **how many seconds have passed since the minute hand pointed at the 12**?

Then we multiply this formula by the formula you worked out for how many degrees the minute hand moves every second and we now have a formula to set the direction of pointing for the minute hand. We will set this direction using the code below. Put this code underneath the code which sets the heading for the second hand:
```
minute_hand.setheading(****your formula in here****)
```

Once you think you have got the formula put this line of code into the ```while True:``` loop, after the code to set the direction of the second hand and run your code. Is the minute hand pointing to the right place? Watch your clock for a while to see if the minute hand is slowly creeping round. Whenever the second hand points at 12 the minute hand should be pointing exactly at one of the minute marks.

### Setting the direction for the hour hand to point

The steps for getting the hour hand to point in the right direction are exactly the same as for the minute hand, except the Python formulas are a little bit more complicated.

First, we need a formula for **how many degrees the hour hand moves in a second**.
Try and work this out using the same logic as for the minute hand - how many degrees there are in a circle, and how many seconds it takes for the hour hand to go all the way round the clock starting with pointing at the 12, until it's pointing to the 12 again.

Second, we need *another* formula for **how many seconds have passed since the time was 12 o'clock**.
This time we need to use all three variables ```H```, ```M``` and ```S```.

Third, we multiply the two formulas together to set the heading for the hour hand. Once you have a formula put it into this line of code and place the code inside the  ```while True:``` loop, after the code to set the direction of the minute hand.
```
hour_hand.setheading(****your formula for the hour hand in here***)
```

Run your code and see if your clock hands are in the right place.

### Stop the clock flickering

You might find the second hand flickering as it moves - this is because Python is trying to redraw all the turtles many times a second. One way to stop this is to add this line of code just before the ```while True:``` loop:
```
tracer(0)
```
and this line of code as the last line *inside* the ```while True:``` loop:
```
update()
```

With these extra lines Python will only redraw the turtles when it has to, so it should stop the flickering.

However, you might now see that the second hand is hidden beneath the other hands. If this is the case you need to move the lines of code where the second hand turtle is created to below the code where the other hand turtles are created. This should ensure the second hand gets drawn after the minute and hour hands.

### Draw the hands in the order you want

Most clocks have the second hand above the minute and hour hands. If you've added the hands in the order of this project you will find the second hand is drawn *under* the hour and minute hands. To change this and put the second hand on top you need to change the order you create the turtles.

Take all the code for creating and defining the second_hand turtle - in one example this code might look like this:
```
second_hand = Turtle()
second_hand.color("red")
screen.register_shape("second hand", ((-1,-4), (1,-4), (1,230), (-1, 230)))
second_hand.shape("second hand")
```

and move it so it is *after* the code which creates and defines the hour_hand and minute_hand turtles. That will result in the second hand being drawn *after* the minute and hour hands, so it will appear on the top.

Hooray - you now have a functioning clock! Congratulations!
