# Making the minute and hour hands move

We are going to follow the same steps we used to make the second hand point in the right direction, first for the minute hand, then for the hour hand.

### Setting the direction for the minute hand

The first step for the minute hand is to work out how many degrees this hand moves every second.

**Here is a very important point:** Python is really good at doing calculations. So coders *never* have to work out difficult sums - the computer can do that. What the coder has to do is **_work out the right formula_** to give the computer so the computer can calculate the right answer.

To work out the formula for the minute hand we can use these facts:

+ at the beginning of the hour the minute hand points up towards 12 o'clock
+ the minute hand takes exactly one hour to go right round the clock until it's pointing at 12 o'clock again
+ there are 360Â° in a circle
+ there are 60 seconds in a minute
+ there are 60 minutes in an hour

What is the formula to give Python so Python can calculate how many degrees the minute hand moves in a second?

Go here for a hint.

The second step is to get the minute hand to point in the right direction.
