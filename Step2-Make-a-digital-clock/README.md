# Making a Digital Clock

#### At this point it's a good idea to start a new .py file. Use File SaveAs to save your code with a new name, for example **digital-clock.py**

We are going to use Python Turtles to show the time in large letters, so we need to import the turtle module. Under the line of code which imports the ```datetime``` module add the code:
```
from turtle import *
```

We will also be using the Python ```sleep()``` function which is in the ```time``` module, so we need to import this:
```
from time import sleep
```


This is a project to use Python turtles to generate a clock which we can display on the screen to show everyone what the time is. 

The first part of the project shows how to find out what the exact time is, and display it as a digital clock.

The more exciting part of the project is to use Python turtles to draw an old-fashioned analogue clock on the screen to have the hands move to show the time. You will be able to use your knowledge to design a personalised clock with your choice of lettering and style of hands.
