# What's the time?

Computers always need to know what the time is, and usually you can see the computer time in a display at the bottom right of your screen. Computers get the exact time from the internet. Python has functions to get the exact computer time so you can use it in your code.

### First: make a new folder where you keep your Python code to keep all your files for this project. You could call it Python-clock.

### Second: start a brand new Python file called get_time.py to put the code for this step in.

The Python functions for finding out about the date or time are in a special *module* called ```datetime``` so the first line of code needs to import this module:

```
from datetime import datetime
```
